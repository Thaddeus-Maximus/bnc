      <description>Leader Chris grew up as a cradle Catholic in Naperville, Illinois. His parents involved him with his parish from a young age going to mass and praying together every night. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until college, that he really grew close to the Catholic church. While attending Illinois State University, he regularly attended the John Paul II Catholic Newman Center where he deepened his relationship with Christ through bible studies, eucharistic adoration, and retreats.</description>
