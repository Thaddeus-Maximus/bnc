BloNo Catholic is a mission-driven young adult community that seeks to unite parishes through evangelization and apostolic teaching within the greater Bloomington-Normal area. Our purpose is to foster authentic Christian fellowship, spread God’s love through acts of service, and develop active lives of prayer for each member.

We are inspired by the words of **Acts 2:42**:

> "And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers."
