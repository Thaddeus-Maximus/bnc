Thad grew up and lives on a farm around Funks Grove, became a mechatronic engineer, and reinvigorated his faith when he joined a Melkite Catholic parish in New Hampshire. He enjoys [making everything](https://thadhughes.xyz/portfolio/) - cars to kombucha to [icons](https://www.littlecreators.shop), singing, and running a publication called [Machinae Ex Deo](https://www.machinaeexdeo.com), exploring how faith informs technological development.
