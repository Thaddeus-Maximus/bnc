Kerri Elson leads a small group that strives to grow in the virtues of faith, hope and charity through using a combination of spiritual reading, Scripture study and group discussion. We pursue genuine community and friendships through our meetings, activities and prayers. We welcome young adult women from all backgrounds and support each other on our faith journeys! Currently we are reading through A Treasured Love Story: Lessons we can learn from St. Therese of Lisieux (taught by Venerable FJ Sheen).
